Notes from 3.5.2 -> 3.5.3

added easier calls for GetCops 

added support for qs phone emails

added option for minigames 'none' so its not required


3.5.3 - > 3.5.4

1) Removed Config.imagelink - too tired of people not changing that and then asking me why images wont load.
  - should work for qb, ps, lj, ox, qs, core, origen. if you use another inventory go to line 147 of the functions.lua in the client folder 
      - make this adjustment
        ```
          elseif GetResourceState('yourinventoryname') == 'started' then
		          return "nui:/yourinventoryname/folder1/folder2/".. QBCore.Shared.Items[img].image
        ```
2 )small bug fixes in meth.lua client side
3) small bug fixes in pharma.lua server side
4) bug allowing to see target for drying weed when waiting for the weed to dry patched
